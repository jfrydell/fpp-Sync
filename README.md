# fpp-Sync

This plugin is part of a [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/jfrydell/fpp-media-server) I made for syncing FPP music playback on a user's phone. This plugin assists with the synchronization by sending MultiSync packets from FPP to a hardcoded POST endpoint.

Obviously, none of this is more than a proof-of-concept, and this component in particular is mostly the product of a day of me trying to figure out how FPP plugins work, rather than any delibrate design.

Thanks to the [fpp-Lora](https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp-LoRa) plugin for the example of a working MultiSync plugin for FPP.
